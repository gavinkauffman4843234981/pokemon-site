<h1>Types</h1>
<span style="font-size: 24px">There are 18 different types in the pokemon franchise, each of them have different weaknesses and strengths and some have immunities. Every pokemon has a type and some have 2 types. Some types have many weaknesses but many strengths, making them offensive types. If a pokemon uses a move that is effective against another pokemon it does 2x damage, if both of the other pokemons types are weak to the type of move you used it will do 4x damage. Some types like ghost, ground, flying, fairy and steel have immunities, meaning moves of certain types wont work against them. ghost is immune to normal and fighting type moves unless the other pokemon has the ability "scrappy". Ground is immune to electric, fairy is immune to dragon, steel is immune to poison, and flying is immune to ground</span>
